# TECHNOSHIELD Security Checklist

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the TECHNOSHIELD project to ensure the protection of data, systems, and users.

## Authentication & Authorization

### JWT Token Security
- [x] JWT tokens are signed with a strong secret key
- [x] Access tokens have a short expiration time (15 minutes)
- [x] Refresh tokens have a longer expiration time (7 days)
- [x] Tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies
- [x] Secure flag is set on cookies for HTTPS-only transmission
- [x] SameSite attribute is set to 'Lax' or 'Strict' to prevent CSRF

### Password Security
- [x] Passwords are hashed using bcrypt with appropriate work factor
- [x] Password strength requirements enforced (minimum length, complexity)
- [x] Account lockout after multiple failed login attempts
- [x] Password reset functionality with secure token generation

### CSRF Protection
- [x] CSRF tokens generated for authenticated sessions
- [x] CSRF tokens validated on state-changing requests
- [x] Double Submit Cookie pattern implemented

### API Protection
- [x] Rate limiting implemented on authentication endpoints
- [x] API endpoints require proper authentication
- [x] Role-based access control for sensitive operations

## Credential Management

### Environment Variables
- [x] Sensitive credentials stored in environment variables
- [x] Example .env file provided without real credentials
- [x] .env files excluded from version control

### Secret Generation
- [x] Script provided for generating secure JWT secrets
- [x] Script provided for generating SSL/TLS certificates

## Web Security

### HTTPS Implementation
- [x] All traffic served over HTTPS
- [x] HTTP to HTTPS redirection
- [x] Strong TLS configuration (TLS 1.2+, secure ciphers)
- [x] HSTS header implemented

### Security Headers
- [x] Content-Security-Policy header configured
- [x] X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- [x] X-Frame-Options: DENY
- [x] X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- [x] Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Input Validation
- [x] All user inputs validated on both client and server
- [x] Parameterized queries used for database operations
- [x] Content type validation on file uploads

## Network Security

### Firewall Configuration
- [x] Only necessary ports exposed in Docker configuration
- [x] Internal services not directly accessible from outside
- [x] Database accessible only from application containers

### API Security
- [x] API rate limiting implemented
- [x] Request size limits configured
- [x] Timeout policies implemented

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Logging
- [x] Authentication attempts logged (success/failure)
- [x] Admin actions logged
- [x] Security-relevant events logged
- [x] Logs include necessary context without sensitive data

### Monitoring
- [x] Prometheus metrics for security events
- [x] Grafana dashboards for security monitoring
- [x] Alerting configured for suspicious activities

## Deployment & Operations

### Docker Security
- [x] Non-root users configured in containers
- [x] Latest base images used
- [x] Unnecessary packages removed from containers
- [x] Docker Compose network segmentation implemented

### Dependency Management
- [x] Regular dependency updates
- [x] Dependency vulnerability scanning
- [x] Minimal dependencies used

## Verification Commands

Use these commands to verify the security implementations:

### Check HTTPS Configuration
```bash
curl -I https://localhost
```
Expected output should include:
- `HTTP/2 200`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains`

### Check Security Headers
```bash
curl -I https://localhost
```
Expected output should include:
- `Content-Security-Policy: ...`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

### Verify JWT Cookie Settings
```bash
# Login first, then check cookie settings
curl -v -X POST https://localhost/api/auth/login -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
```
Expected output should include:
- `Set-Cookie: access_token=...; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`
- `Set-Cookie: refresh_token=...; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`

### Check Rate Limiting
```bash
# Run multiple requests in quick succession
for i in {1..20}; do curl -I https://localhost/api/auth/login; done
```
Expected output should eventually include:
- `HTTP/2 429` (Too Many Requests)
