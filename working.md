# TECHNOSHIELD: Detailed System Documentation

## System Overview

TECHNOSHIELD is a comprehensive cybersecurity platform designed for monitoring, detecting, and responding to security threats. The system integrates data collection, processing, threat detection, and incident management into a unified solution with a modern web interface.

## System Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture with these main components:

1. **Backend API** - FastAPI-based REST API service
2. **Frontend** - React-based web application
3. **Data Processing Pipeline** - Python-based data collection and analysis system
4. **Database** - PostgreSQL for data storage
5. **Monitoring** - Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and visualization

All components are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy deployment.

## Component Details

### 1. Data Processing Pipeline

The pipeline is the core data processing engine that handles security event collection, normalization, and threat detection.

#### Main Process Flow (pipeline/main.py)

The pipeline follows this workflow:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Load environment variables
   - Set up logging
   - Start metrics updater
   - Establish database connection
   - Load configuration

2. **Main Processing Loop**:
   - Collect data from configured sources
   - Process and normalize events
   - Analyze events for security threats
   - Generate alerts for detected threats
   - Store results in the database
   - Sleep to maintain the configured processing interval

The main loop runs continuously with configurable intervals, ensuring real-time monitoring.

#### Data Collection (pipeline/ingest/data_collector.py)

The data collector module:

- Supports multiple data source types:
  - API sources (REST APIs, SOAP services)
  - File sources (log files, CSV, JSON)
  - Syslog sources (system logs)
- Handles authentication and connection to external systems
- Adds metadata to collected events (source name, type, collection time)
- Implements error handling and metrics recording
- Uses a metrics server to expose collection statistics

Collection process:
1. Iterate through configured data sources
2. Apply source-specific collection logic
3. Add metadata to each collected event
4. Return combined list of raw events

#### Event Processing (pipeline/process/event_processor.py)

The event processor module:

- Normalizes data from different sources into a standard format
- Applies source-specific processing logic
- Extracts key information like timestamps, IPs, and users
- Handles different event types with specialized processors

Processing steps:
1. Determine event source type
2. Apply appropriate processor based on source type
3. Create normalized event structure with standard fields
4. Extract and normalize timestamps, IPs, users, and other relevant data

#### Threat Detection (pipeline/models/threat_detector.py)

The threat detector module:

- Groups events by source IP for correlation
- Applies multiple detection rules:
  - Authentication attacks (brute force, credential stuffing)
  - Malware indicators (signatures, behaviors)
  - Suspicious network activity (port scanning, unusual traffic)
  - Data exfiltration (large outbound transfers, unusual access patterns)
- Deduplicates alerts to reduce noise
- Records metrics on detected threats

Detection process:
1. Group events by source IP for correlation
2. Apply various detection rules to events
3. Generate alerts for detected threats
4. Deduplicate alerts to reduce noise
5. Record metrics on detection results

#### Database Connector (pipeline/utils/db_connector.py)

The database connector module:

- Manages PostgreSQL database connections
- Defines schema for alerts and events tables
- Handles storing and retrieving security data
- Prevents duplicate alerts

Database schema includes:
- Alerts table: stores security alerts with severity, source, status
- Events table: stores normalized security events

### 2. Backend API

The backend provides RESTful API endpoints for the frontend and other services.

#### API Structure (backend/app/main.py)

The API is built with FastAPI and includes:

- OpenAPI documentation
- CORS middleware for cross-origin requests
- Session middleware for authentication
- GZip compression for responses
- Request metrics recording

#### API Routes (backend/app/api/routes/)

The API is organized into these main areas:

- **/auth** - Authentication and user management
  - Login/logout
  - Token refresh
  - Password reset

- **/alerts** - Security alert management
  - List alerts with filtering
  - Create new alerts
  - Update alert status
  - Get alert details

- **/incidents** - Security incident management
  - List incidents with filtering
  - Create incidents from alerts
  - Update incident status
  - Add notes and evidence

- **/users** - User profile and settings
  - User registration
  - Profile management
  - Preference settings

#### Security Features

The backend implements several security measures:

- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- CORS protection for API endpoints
- Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- HTTPS enforcement
- Input validation with Pydantic schemas

### 3. Frontend Application

The frontend is a React-based single-page application with a modern UI.

#### Application Structure (frontend/src/App.jsx)

The application uses React Router for navigation and includes:

- Authentication routes (login, register)
- Main application routes (dashboard, alerts, incidents, settings)
- Protected routes requiring authentication

#### Main Features

- **Dashboard**: Overview of security posture with metrics and visualizations
- **Alerts Management**: View, filter, and respond to security alerts
- **Incident Response**: Manage security incidents with workflow tracking
- **Reporting**: Generate security reports and analytics
- **User Management**: User authentication and profile settings
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Configurable UI theme

#### Components Structure

The frontend is organized into:

- **Pages**: Main application views (Dashboard, Alerts, Incidents, Reports, Settings)
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements
  - Layout components (MainLayout, AuthLayout)
  - Dashboard widgets (AlertSummary, IncidentSummary, MetricCard, ThreatMap)
  - Form components
  - Table components
- **Context Providers**: State management (AuthContext, ThemeContext)
- **API Services**: Backend communication
- **Utilities**: Helper functions

#### UI Design

The UI uses Tailwind CSS for styling with:

- Responsive design for desktop and mobile
- Dark/light theme support
- Consistent color scheme defined in config.js
- Interactive components (charts, maps, tables)

### 4. Monitoring and Metrics

The system includes comprehensive monitoring for operational visibility.

#### Monitoring Components

- **Prometheus**: Collects and stores metrics
- **Grafana**: Provides dashboards and visualizations
- **Node Exporter**: Collects host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- **cAdvisor**: Collects container-level metrics

#### Custom Metrics

Both the backend and pipeline expose custom metrics:

- **Backend Metrics**:
  - Request counts and latencies
  - Authentication success/failure rates
  - Alert and incident counts

- **Pipeline Metrics**:
  - Data collection statistics by source
  - Processing times
  - Threat detection counts by type
  - Error rates

#### Logging

The system implements structured logging with:

- JSON-formatted logs for machine readability
- Log rotation to manage file sizes
- Different log levels for various event types
- Specialized loggers for security events, errors, and operational data

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

The system is designed for containerized deployment with Docker Compose:

- **PostgreSQL**: Database container

### Security Considerations

- SSL/TLS encryption for all communications
- Secure password storage with bcrypt
- JWT token-based authentication
- Container isolation for components
- Principle of least privilege for service accounts

## Data Flow

2. **Processing**: Events are normalized into a standard format
3. **Analysis**: Threat detection rules are applied to identify security issues
4. **Alert Generation**: Alerts are created for detected threats
5. **Storage**: Alerts are stored in the database
6. **Presentation**: Frontend displays alerts to security analysts
7. **Response**: Analysts can create incidents from alerts and manage response
8. **Resolution**: Incidents are tracked through resolution

### API Communication

1. **Authentication**: Frontend authenticates with backend using JWT
2. **Data Retrieval**: Frontend requests alerts, incidents, and metrics
3. **Updates**: Frontend sends updates for alert and incident status
4. **Metrics**: Backend and pipeline expose metrics for monitoring
