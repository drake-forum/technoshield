# TECHNOSHIELD Architecture

## Overview

TECHNOSHIELD is designed as a modern, scalable security operations platform with a clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and data processing components.

## System Architecture

## Component Details

### 1. Frontend

The frontend is a single-page application built with React.js that provides the user interface for security analysts and administrators.

#### Key Technologies:
- **React**: Core UI library
- **React Router**: Client-side routing
- **React Query**: Data fetching and state management
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Chart.js**: Data visualization
- **D3.js**: Advanced visualizations (threat map)

#### Core Components:
- **Layout**: Main layout with sidebar, header, and content area
- **Auth**: Login and registration pages
- **Dashboard**: Overview with metrics and visualizations
- **Alerts**: Alert listing and detail pages
- **Incidents**: Incident management pages
- **Reports**: Security reporting and analytics
- **Settings**: User and system configuration

### 2. Backend

The backend is a RESTful API built with FastAPI that handles business logic, data processing, and database operations.

#### Key Technologies:
- **FastAPI**: API framework
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database operations
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management
- **JWT**: Authentication
- **Alembic**: Database migrations

#### Core Modules:
- **API Routes**: Endpoint definitions
- **Models**: Database models
- **Schemas**: Pydantic models for request/response validation
- **CRUD**: Database operations
- **Core**: Configuration and security
- **Services**: Business logic

### 3. Database

PostgreSQL is used as the primary database for storing all application data.

#### Key Tables:
- **users**: User accounts and profiles
- **alerts**: Security alerts from various sources
- **incidents**: Security incidents created from alerts
- **reports**: Generated security reports

### 4. Pipeline

The data processing pipeline is responsible for ingesting, analyzing, and enriching security data from various sources.

#### Key Components:
- **Ingest**: Data collection from external sources
- **Process**: Data normalization and enrichment
- **Models**: Anomaly detection and threat scoring
- **Output**: Alert generation and database storage

## Authentication Flow

1. User submits login credentials
2. Backend validates credentials and generates JWT token
3. Frontend stores token in local storage
4. Token is included in Authorization header for subsequent requests
5. Backend validates token for protected endpoints

## Data Flow

### Alert Processing

1. External security data is ingested by the pipeline
2. Data is normalized, enriched, and analyzed
3. Alerts are generated and stored in the database
4. Backend API exposes alerts to the frontend
5. Frontend displays alerts and allows user interaction

### Incident Management

1. User creates an incident from one or more alerts
2. Incident is stored in the database with relationships to alerts
3. Users can update incident status and add information
4. Incident metrics are calculated for reporting

## Scalability Considerations

- **Frontend**: Can be deployed to CDN for global distribution
- **Backend**: Stateless design allows horizontal scaling
- **Database**: Vertical scaling for initial deployment, with potential for read replicas
- **Pipeline**: Can be scaled horizontally for increased data processing

## Security Considerations

- JWT-based authentication with short-lived tokens
- Role-based access control for different user types
- Input validation using Pydantic schemas
- HTTPS for all communications
- Environment-based configuration for sensitive values
- Password hashing with bcrypt

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live alerts
- **Advanced Analytics**: Machine learning for threat detection
- **Automation**: Playbooks for automated response actions
- **Integration**: APIs for third-party security tools
- **Multi-tenancy**: Support for multiple organizations
